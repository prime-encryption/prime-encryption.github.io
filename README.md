# Prime Encryption

Prime Encryption tool is a small project made mainly to practice creating front-end using [Angular](https://angular.io/). It encrypts or decrypts a piece of text using a custom-designed algorithm based on prime numbers.

## Warning!

This project's encryption algorithm is only a proof-of-concept, and has not been professionally tested for security.

Our algorithm may contain certain flaws unknown to the author, that could result in breaking the encryption and revealing the encrypted data.
